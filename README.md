# BMI-stratified polygenic prediction of type 2 diabetes

## Overview
This repository provides codes used for BMI-stratified polygenic prediction of type 2 diabetes using the genomic data from more than 250,000 participants in BioBank Japan, UK Biobank, and Tohoku Medical Megabank.

## Data availability
The genotype data of BBJ are available at the NBDC Human Database (research ID: hum0014 and hum0311). The UKB analysis was conducted via application number 47821 (https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/). Individual genotyping results and other cohort data used for the polygenic prediction are stored in Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization (ToMMo). In response to reasonable requests for these data (contact us at 
<ist@megabank.tohoku.ac.jp>), we will share the stored data after assembling the data set after approval of the Ethics Committee and Materials and Information Distribution Review Committee of ToMMo. The PRSs developed for TMM and BBJ-2nd have been released through the [PGS Catalog](https://www.pgscatalog.org) with publication ID PGP000593 and score IDs PGS004615-PGS004620. The PRSs can also be accessed through application at the NBDC with the accession code [hum0197](https://humandbs.biosciencedbc.jp/en/hum0197-latest).
